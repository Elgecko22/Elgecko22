## About Me

An aspiring Business Analyst, I bring a blend of academic experience, hands-on projects, and real-world leadership from both being a project manager and a head lifeguard. At Cal Poly, I’ve developed technical skills through coursework and certifications in R (Studio), Python, and data analytics, while applying them in capstone projects, business case analyses, and work.

Whether it's building dashboards, analyzing data sets, or optimizing business processes, I focus on clarity, efficiency, and impact. I’m actively pursuing roles in **Data Analytics or Business Analysis**
