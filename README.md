## About Me

As a student and aspiring data analyst, I bring a blend of academic experience, hands-on projects, and real-world leadership. At Cal Poly, I‚Äôve developed technical skills through coursework and certifications in R (Studio), Python, and data analytics, while applying them in capstone projects, business case analyses, and internship work.

My professional background includes leading lifeguard teams as a Head Guard and mentoring incoming transfer students. I excel in roles that require cross-functional coordination, team work, and data-driven insight. 

Whether it's building dashboards, analyzing data sets, or optimizing business processes, I focus on clarity, efficiency, and impact. I‚Äôm actively pursuing roles in **Data Analytics or Data Science**.
